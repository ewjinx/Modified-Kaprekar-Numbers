# Modified-Kaprekar-Numbers
A simple C++ program that takes in a range of values and outputs all Kaprekar numbers that lie between the range.

## What is a Kaprekar number?
A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property. If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same value you started with.

For example:  
9  
9<sup>2</sup> = 81  
81 â†’ 8 1  
8 + 1 = 9
